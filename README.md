## Seminar in Race, Climate Change, and Environmental Justice 


Climate change, racial injustice, and inequities are deeply intertwined. Colonialism, slavery, and the genocide of indigenous peoples are directly linked to natural resource exploitation, environmental degradation, and global warming. Our seminar aims to focus on placing race, gender, and class at the center of discussions of the environment, climate, and equity. Our goal is to create an academic space that enables collaborative dialogue, action, and insight for systemic change towards racial equity and understanding within a climate and environment context. 

The seminar is open to the Columbia community. Please [RSVP](https://eesc.columbia.edu/content/seminar-race-climate-change-and-environmental-justice-gr9810)  for each individual session.
